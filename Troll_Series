Hello challenge takers!

The attached zip contains a VMDK file for you to undertake this hacking challenge. You will find the dropbox link at the bottom of this file.

This box is used for three challenges!
  Break and Enter;
  Next Step: Root; and
  System Rooted.
You won't need more than one copy of the box.

If you are unfamiliar with VMDK you would be best to set up Oracle VM Virtualbox to open the VMDK file and undertake our challenges.
